# Playground
## Intent
Train better and fast implementing DPs.
## How to use?
1. Copy DP `Main.php` content to playground's `Main.php`
2. Try to write code in `Structure` folder that make success run of the `Main.php` code

## Git advices
Surely, it is always good practice keeping the playground clean after play!

Then just run below code after finishing the play 
> git stash

But if you like to keep this playground, commit it on a new branch
> git checkout -b DP1_PLAYGROUND
>
> git commit -m "keep my playground"
